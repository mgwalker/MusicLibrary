This thing looked through directories recursively finding MP3 files, attempted
to read ID3 tags for metadata, and then output the result to standard output,
XML, or a templated HTML file. It worked! I used to keep an XML file describing
my personal MP3 library. I don't know why. It was just a thing I had.
